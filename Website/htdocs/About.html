                HelixOS is an indie operating system based on Ubuntu, its goal is to be intuitive both for use and for forks and projects that are built on top of it.

                Its development began in 2022 under another name, but it only became official in 2025, when the first commit was made on GitHub.

                The project is assembled through Cubic (custom Ubuntu ISO creator) and is used precisely because it is intuitive.

                HelixOS is open source, the only closed source things are the Private Betas, because they are more likely to have fatal bugs that can affect both the integrity of the system and security.

                If you want to download HelixOS, the download links for LiveISO.iso and Source-Code are in the Downloads tab of the website.
